# LinuxTools

This toolset was originally made on a centos7 machine. 

To start using this toolset, run the following:
   source tools.sh
   SetupTools

These commands will source the tools, and then install necessary packages to support functionality of the tools. 

## Tips and Tricks!

These are just some helpful tips I've picked up along the way :)

Turns of the annoying motherboard beep

service sshd restart:
Restarts the ssh setup. This fixed my problem with "connection refused" errors when trying to ssh
